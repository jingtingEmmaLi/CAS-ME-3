6th column: Synchronization of physiological signals with video based on the marker "5" in the table:‌ Specifically, in the physiological data table (assuming column indexing starts from 0), synchronization begins when the number "5" first appears in the 6th column. In other words, during data collection, the marker "5" serves as the synchronization signal—when a label of "5" is recorded, it indicates the synchronization point for micro-expression audio-video recording.

other columns are Useless channels with no meaningful information.
